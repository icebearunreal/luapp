# luapp
luapp is a superset of lua with classes, types and stuff. It's going to be great

C++ is to C what LuaPP is to Lua. 
Of course I love lua, but sometimes I wish I could have.. more!!!!

Soon I'll deviate from the lovely lua syntax and, although we'll still have backward compatibility, we'll walk in typescript's direction (oh god no)
