# luapp
luapp is a superset of lua with classes, types and stuff. It's going to be great

C++ is to C what LuaPP is to Lua. 
Of course I love lua, but sometimes I wish I could have.. more!!!!

Soon I'll deviate from the lovely lua syntax and, although we'll still have backward compatibility, we'll walk in typescript's direction (oh god no)
|FEATURES| DESCRIPTION|
|C support| Yeah i think u can just get straight to running C from within the program.. pretty cracked tbh, made because i was bored, as a *joke*, oh gosh stuff evolves fast|
|Classes| Uh classes|
|Types| Yeah types. Not gonna elaborate|
|Better linking to other files| use `LinkTo "mathutils/example.lpp"` and it replaces require() in some regards|
